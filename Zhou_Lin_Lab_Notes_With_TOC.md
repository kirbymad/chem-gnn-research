## üìç Current Role
I am working as an undergraduate researcher under **Siqi Chen** in the **Zhou Lin Lab** at UMass Chemical Engineering. Our project focuses on developing a **Fragment-Based Graph Neural Network** (FBGNN) model integrated with **Many-Body Expansion (MBE)** theory to predict full-dimensional **potential energy surfaces (FD-PES)**.

## üß™ Project Overview

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Objective
- Efficiently model large molecular and material systems using **first-principles QM data**.
- Apply **Many-Body Expansion (MBE)** to fragment large systems.
- Use a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** to learn fragment interactions and predict system-level energies.

### üß¨ Method
- Divide complex chemical systems into **1-body, 2-body, ... n-body** fragments.
- Perform **Q-Chem** calculations to get reference energies.
- Train a custom GNN (FBGNN) on these fragment features.
- Predict many-body energy corrections to reconstruct the total energy.

## üß† What Model Am I Working With?

### ‚úÖ Fragment-Based Graph Neural Network with MBE (FBGNN-MBE)

- Combines **fragment-wise QM calculations** with a **GNN architecture**.
- Designed to capture many-body energy contributions and build FD-PES.
- Custom GNN likely defined in `mbe_models/train.py` or `run_models.py`.

### üîç How to Inspect the Model

```bash
cd mbe_models
grep -i model *.py
```

Look for architecture classes like `FBGNNModel`, `GraphNet`, or `MPNN`.

## üìå Notes to Self

- Check `MBE_new` for the most up-to-date scripts/configs.
- `q-chem` is where input/output files for QM calculations live.
- Make sure your `chem_environment.yml` is synced with `conda env`.
- Keep backups of your datasets and results outside of Unity‚Äîstorage is not backed up!
- Use `copy_env.sh` to reproduce Siqi‚Äôs working environment.
- Useful command:
  ```bash
  unity-compute  # to switch to a compute node
  ```
